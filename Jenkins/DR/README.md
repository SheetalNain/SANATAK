## Introduction

This document outlines the key strategies and best practices for disaster recovery in Jenkins. It covers backup and restore procedures, and emergency recovery steps.

---

## What is Disaster Recovery?

Disaster Recovery (DR) is a strategic plan to protect critical systems, applications, and data from unexpected events like natural disasters, cyber-attacks, or hardware failures. Its main goal is to minimize downtime and data loss, ensuring a swift recovery and business continuity after disruptions.

---

## Why do we need a Disaster Recovery Plan for Jenkins?

Running a Jenkins master on a single machine creates a Single Point of Failure (SPOF). If lost due to hardware failure, accidental deletion, or other disasters, rebuilding it can be complex and time-consuming, disrupting workflows and delaying software delivery. A robust Disaster Recovery (DR) plan minimizes downtime, ensures high availability, and enables quick recovery, keeping operations seamless even during unexpected failures.

## Scope of DR in Jenkins

| **Component**             | **Action/Process**                                                                                  | 
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Backup Strategy**        | Regular backups of Jenkins home directory, build artifacts, logs, and credentials.                 | 
| **Jenkins Home Directory** | Store critical data (jobs, plugins, configurations) in a secure location.                          | 
| **Build Artifacts and Logs** | Backup workspace directories and logs to preserve build history.                                  | 
| **Secrets and Credentials** | Securely back up sensitive data stored in Jenkins.                                                  | 
| **Failover Process**       | Redirect traffic to backup Jenkins master in case of failure.                                       | 
| **Restore Process**        | Restore configurations and jobs from the latest backup.                                             | 
| **Automation for Recovery** | Automate failover and restoration processes for quick recovery.                                     |

## Back Up

**Backup** is crucial to ensure that Jenkins data, configurations, jobs, and plugins are preserved and can be restored when needed. There are two types of backups you can set up for Jenkins:

| Type | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Manual Backup**      | Manually copy the Jenkins home directory to a backup location. The home directory includes important data like job configurations, build artifacts, and plugin settings.            |
| **Automated Backup**  | Install the ThinBackup Plugin to automate Jenkins backups. The plugin allows scheduling of incremental backups to cloud storage or a local backup server. |

### Jenkins Backup Plugins

| Plugin                         | Description                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ThinBackup Plugin**          | Automates Jenkins backups with features like scheduled backups, incremental backups, and restoration support. |
| **Backup Plugin**              | Provides backup capabilities for Jenkins data and configurations, supporting various storage options. |

## Recovery

The **recovery** process restores Jenkins services using the most recent backup. The recovery process includes - 

| Recovery | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Restore from Backup**      |  Restore the Jenkins home directory from the backup location. This will bring back the job configurations, build history, and plugins.        |
| **Automated Recovery**  | Use automation tools like Ansible or Terraform to restore Jenkins configurations and jobs. These tools can also deploy a new Jenkins server instance if necessary. |

## MTTR
MTTR is the average time it takes to recover from a failure, incident, or data loss. It is a key metric in assessing the efficiency of your recovery processes.

MTTR Components:

| Component | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Detection Time**      | Time taken to identify the failure or data loss. With monitoring tools, you can quickly detect issues affecting Jenkins data.         |
| **Resolution Time**  | Time taken to resolve the issue. |
| **Restoration Time**  | Time taken to restore services to normal operation. |

## Advantages and Disadvantages

| **Advantages**                     | **Disadvantages**                              |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|1. Minimized Downtime              |  1. Cost of Redundancy                  |
| 2. Data Protection                 | 2. Maintenance Overhead                |
| 3. Business Continuity             | 3. Risk of Data Inconsistency                |
| 4. Security of Sensitive Data     |  4.  False Sense of Security     |
| 5. Reduced Operational Risk       |  5. Performance Overhead         |

## Conclusion

Disaster Recovery (DR) in Jenkins ensures quick recovery from failures, keeping build, test, and deployment processes running smoothly. In microservices projects, where Jenkins manages multiple services, DR helps restore functionality quickly, preventing delays and maintaining workflow continuity.
